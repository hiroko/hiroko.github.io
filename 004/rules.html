          <li>No Spend Days: How many "No Spend Days" can you get in 100 days?</li>
          <li>When spending money, be mindful of your goal and what you are spending. Do you really <i>need</i> this, or do you want this just as an impulse? If you're shopping online, put it in your cart, and come back a week later. Do you still need or want it?  Chances are, you'd probably completely forgotten about it.</li>
          <li>Try to eat in as often as possible.  How many times a week do you eat out? Can you decrease that? If not, can you decrease the amount of money you spend? Appetizers, alcohol, and dessert are some places where you can easily shave off $10-20 off any meal.</li>
