How long will it take to receive my order?

Domestic orders of stickers and silicon wristbands should be shipped within 2 weeks after order (usually much quicker), via First Class Mail.  Please give 3 weeks for handmade items (such as hand-woven bracelets) to be shipped out, as they are made to order.
Please allow up to 2 months for the domestic packages to arrive to you to account for circumstances beyond our control that sometimes occur.
However, if you do not receive a shipping receipt by a month, please feel free to e-mail us, and we will be happy to provide an update.
If you need the items ASAP (support group meetings, events, etc.), please e-mail us at shop@avmalformation.org and we will try our best to accommodate.
